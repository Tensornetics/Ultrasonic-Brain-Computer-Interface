# Ultrasonic-Brain-Computer-Interface
Ultrasonic Brain-Computer Interface

This project provides a Python script for measuring and analyzing brain activity using an array of ultrasonic sensors. The script includes the following features:

Initialization of an array of ultrasonic sensors with user-specified sensitivity and frequency range
Measurement of brain activity using the sensor array for a specified duration
Processing and classification of brain activity data using a machine learning model implemented in TensorFlow
Storage of brain activity data and classification in a cloud database
Dependencies

This script requires the following libraries:

NumPy
SciPy
TensorFlow
Usage

To use the script, simply run the main function. The script will initialize the sensor array, measure brain activity, process and classify the data, and store the results in a cloud database.

#Configuration

The following parameters can be configured in the script:

num_sensors: The number of ultrasonic sensors in the array
sensitivity: The sensitivity of the sensors (in mV)
frequency_range: The frequency range of the sensors (in Hz)

#Output

The script will output the following:

Brain activity tensor: A tensor containing the brain activity measurements from all sensors in the array
Classification: The classification of the brain activity data produced by the machine learning model
The brain activity tensor and classification will also be stored in the cloud database for later access.

#Limitations

The current version of the script has the following limitations:

The measurement duration is fixed at 60 seconds
The machine learning model is a simple feedforward neural network with a fixed architecture
The cloud database connection is not configurable
Future Work

#Possible future improvements to the script include:

Adding the ability to customize the measurement duration
Expanding the capabilities of the machine learning model (e.g. using a more complex architecture or incorporating additional features)
Adding the ability to configure the cloud database connection
